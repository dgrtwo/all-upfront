        Behind North Carolina's New Data Platform Powered by Upfront
      </h1>

      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-brand-gray">
        <p>
          As a lead agency for North Carolina's entire Child Care Resource & Referral (CCR&R) network, Child Care Resources Inc. (CCRI) supports families, providers, and regional partners in ways that go far beyond what appears on a website. Together with Upfront, CCRI has built an integrated statewide system that redefines how child care data is collected, managed, and acted upon — connecting every piece of the ecosystem in one place.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-10 mb-4">For Families: Search, Connect, and Access Care in Minutes</h2>
        <p>
          CCRI's new public online search portal — FindChildcareNC.com — is the most comprehensive child care search in the state. Families can:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Filter by schedule, age, quality rating, pricing, languages, special needs, and more</li>
          <li>View real-time vacancy data, so they're not calling closed or full programs</li>
          <li>Access the tool seamlessly from any device, with full mobile optimization and multilingual support</li>
          <li>Find results ranked for SEO to ensure every family searching online can discover it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Behind the public search is a robust referral intake system used by family specialists statewide. It allows CCR&R staff to:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Create referrals in minutes using the same real-time vacancy data that powers the public search</li>
          <li>Manage family cases through a full call intake workflow, with automated surveys and tracking</li>
          <li>View dashboards showing call volume, trends, and response rates — so operations can continuously improve</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-10 mb-4">For Providers: Easy Account Management and Professional Growth</h2>
        <p>
          CCRI's work extends equally to supporting the providers who make North Carolina's early care and education system possible. The provider portal enables every licensed program to:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Claim and verify their account in less than two minutes</li>
          <li>Update data directly — from vacancies and pricing to hours and contact information — ensuring accuracy across the system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For Professional Development and Training, CCR&R teams can:</p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Publish courses in a public catalog for providers to register through directly</li>
          <li>Providers are able to pay online for training through a fully integrated payment system that automatically routes funds to the correct region</li>
          <li>For staff, create, duplicate, and edit courses effortlessly, tracking participation across every topic and geography</li>
          <li>Access dashboards that show which regions are most active and where additional capacity is needed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Technical Assistance and Coaching module gives CCR&R specialists the tools to quantify their impact with early educators. Staff can:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Log visits, create new coaching sessions, and manage provider engagement</li>
          <li>Use configurable assessment templates that automatically calculate results and outcomes</li>
          <li>Generate analytics to show where coaching efforts are most concentrated and where support gaps remain</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-10 mb-4">For All: Real-Time Data and Reporting That Drives Change</h2>
        <p>Every module connects into a single data and reporting backbone. CCRI and regional partners can:</p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Run pre-built report templates or create custom self-service exports across families, providers, training, coaching, and referrals</li>
          <li>Access real-time supply and demand maps visualizing where care is available — and where it's not</li>
          <li>Analyze affordability deserts by viewing program costs as a percentage of median household income (MHI), revealing where child care is financially out of reach for families</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-10 mb-4">Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          The launch of this statewide system is more than a technology upgrade — it's a rethinking of how North Carolina serves its families and early educators. From the first call a parent makes to the data driving state policy decisions, CCRI's infrastructure ensures that every interaction is informed, efficient, and equitable.
