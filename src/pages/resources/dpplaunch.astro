        Denver Preschool Program Launches New Application and Online Search
      </h1>

      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-brand-gray">
        <p>
          On October 1, 2025, the Denver Preschool Program (DPP) officially launched a new application and Preschool Finder Tool — powered by Upfront — designed to make life easier for families seeking preschool and for providers serving them.
        </p>
        <p>
          For nearly two decades, DPP has helped to ensure that every Denver child has access to high-quality preschool, regardless of income or neighborhood. This new platform takes that mission further by combining real-time data, streamlined applications, and accessible design into one seamless experience, while still providing the individualized support that families and providers know and trust.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-10 mb-4">Smarter Online Search for Families</h2>
        <p>
          Families can now use the new Preschool Finder Tool at find.dpp.org to explore preschool options across Denver. The new Preschool Finder Tool includes:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Real-time vacancy data so families can immediately see which programs have open spots</li>
          <li>Last updated timestamps so parents know how current the information is</li>
          <li>A seamless provider experience to keep vacancy data accurate and up to date</li>
          <li>Accessibility by design with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 compliance and translation into more than 10 languages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This means families can not only find the right preschool but also confirm availability without making endless phone calls or relying on outdated lists.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-10 mb-4">A Streamlined Application Process</h2>
        <p>
          The application itself has been redesigned to save families time and reduce frustration. Key improvements include:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 my-4">
          <li><strong>Eligibility screening upfront:</strong> Families who are not currently eligible are flagged early, avoiding wasted time while still capturing their contact information for future outreach.</li>
          <li><strong>Integrated provider data:</strong> Families can view which programs have open spots while applying, allowing them to select programs immediately without needing to call each one.</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile-friendly document upload:</strong> Families can securely upload required documents straight from their phones, enabling on-the-go applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-10 mb-4">Behind the Scenes: Analytics and Impact</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to creating a better user experience, the platform equips DPP with powerful analytics to understand how families navigate the process, where drop-offs occur, and how to further improve access. This real-time insight will allow DPP to reach more families effectively and ensure providers are connected to the children who need them.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-10 mb-4">A New Era for Preschool Access in Denver</h2>
        <p>
          The Denver Preschool Program has long been a leader in expanding access to early childhood education. With this launch, families have a smarter, simpler way to find preschool, providers have a stronger way to connect with families, and the city has a data-driven system to support equity and access.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upfront is proud to partner with DPP and MetrixIQ on this transformation. Together, we're ensuring that every family in Denver can more easily find and afford the preschool their child deserves.
