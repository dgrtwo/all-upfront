        ECE Search: What Modern Families Want
      </h1>

      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-brand-gray">
        <p>
          As government organizations, the goal is to make your resources and services as accessible and efficient as possible for the communities you serve. With more families than ever searching online for child care information, it is essential to adapt how program data is accessed. Understanding what modern families want when searching for programs is the first step in delivering on their expectations.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-10 mb-4">Mobile Optimization: A Non-negotiable</h2>
        <p>
          Approximately 80% of families conduct their child care search using their mobile phones. This shift in user behavior requires child care search websites to be mobile-optimized, ensuring they are easily usable and correctly formatted for smaller screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, surprisingly, 75% of current search portals are not mobile-optimized, which results in a high user drop-off rate out of frustration. Ensuring your website is mobile-friendly is crucial for retaining user attention and effectively connecting them to suitable ECE programs.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-10 mb-4">Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Can Families Find Your Site?</h2>
        <p>
          Families frequently rely on search engines like Google. It's where most journeys begin, and an SEO-friendly website is more likely to appear in these search results. Specifically, unique URLs for every program are a key aspect of SEO-friendly website design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unique URLs contribute to better site organization and provide clear pathways for search engine bots, which enhances a site's visibility. They also make it easier for users to share and return to specific programs they are interested in, which improves the user experience.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-10 mb-4">User-Friendly Design: Simplicity is Key</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to being mobile-optimized and SEO-friendly, ECE search websites must prioritize user-friendly design. Modern families value convenience and simplicity. They expect to access information quickly, without having to navigate through cumbersome processes or provide extensive details upfront.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, asking for many inputs like addresses on the homepage can be frustrating to users who are just beginning their search. Instead, the focus should be on making filters intuitive, such as using drop-down menus rather than open text. An easy-to-navigate, intuitive interface can significantly enhance user experience, leading to better chances of enrollment.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-brand-light rounded-xl p-6 mt-8">
          <p class="text-brand-navy font-semibold mb-2">Key Takeaway</p>
          <p class="text-brand-gray">
            By ensuring your child care search website is mobile-optimized, SEO-friendly, and user-friendly, you are supporting both the families and providers in your community.
