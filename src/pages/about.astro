      <p class="text-brand-gray mb-4">
        Upfront is on a mission to bring accurate, comprehensive data to every person in early childhood—from families searching for care, to providers managing their programs, to policymakers shaping the systems that support them.
      </p>
      <p class="text-brand-gray">
        We believe access to clear, real-time information is the foundation of a stronger, more equitable childcare system. Across the country, families struggle to find care, programs operate below capacity, and agencies lack the insights they need to make data-driven decisions. Upfront exists to fix that.

          <p class="text-brand-gray mb-4">
            Dana witnessed firsthand the challenges a family faces when searching for her own childcare. As a parent, she wanted to empower families to make decisions quickly and seamlessly and saw an opportunity to bring data tools to the childcare space.
          </p>
          <p class="text-brand-gray">
            She was previously the Chief of Staff at VirtualHealth, a growth-stage SaaS for Medicaid startup where she led operations, business development, and human resources. Dana saw how connecting databases into a single location improved decisions for every patient, provider, and payer.
